# Phase 1: Foundational Analysis and Planning

This document outlines the plan for the first phase of the project, which focuses on analyzing the existing codebase, establishing a new architectural blueprint, and creating the necessary documentation to guide the development process.

## 1. Deep Code Analysis

*   **Objective**: To gain a comprehensive understanding of the current codebase, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and define a clear refactoring strategy.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Review the existing codebase to understand its architecture, design patterns, and overall structure.
    *   Identify key areas for improvement, such as performance bottlenecks, security vulnerabilities, and code complexity.
    *   Map out a detailed refactoring plan, including a list of components to be refactored, new design patterns to be implemented, and a timeline for completion.

## 2. Architectural Blueprint

*   **Objective**: To design a new, scalable, and resilient architecture that can support 100 million subscribers.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Define the high-level architecture, including the choice of microservices, serverless functions, and other architectural patterns.
    *   Create detailed diagrams and specifications for the new architecture, including system diagrams, data flow models, and API specifications.
    *   Select the technology stack for the new architecture, including programming languages, frameworks, databases, and other tools.

## 3. Documentation

*   **Objective**: To create a comprehensive set of documentation to support the development process and ensure the long-term maintainability of the project.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Create a **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** that outlines the product's vision, features, and functional and non-functional requirements.
    *   Develop an **Architectural Blueprint** document that details the new architecture and technology stack.
    *   Create a **Developer Onboarding** guide to help new developers get up to speed quickly.

## 4. Project Roadmap

*   **Objective**: To create a detailed project plan that breaks down the work into manageable milestones.
*   **Tasks**:
    *   Define the project's milestones, including timelines and deliverables for each phase.
    *   Create a detailed project schedule, including a list of tasks, dependencies, and resource allocation.
    *   Establish a project management process, including regular team meetings, progress tracking, and risk management.
