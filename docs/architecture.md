# System Architecture — Streaming
> Version: 1.0 | Last Updated: 2026-02-18 | Status: Draft
> Classification: Internal | Author: AIDD System

## 1. Architecture Overview

Streaming follows a cloud-native microservices architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability within the BillyRonks ecosystem.

## 2. Architecture Principles

- **Cloud-Native**: Kubernetes-first deployment model
- **Microservices**: Loosely coupled, independently deployable services
- **API-First**: All functionality exposed via well-defined APIs
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via message brokers
- **Security by Design**: Zero-trust networking, encryption everywhere

## 3. System Components

### 3.1 Core Services
| Service | Responsibility | Technology |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| API Gateway | Request routing, auth, rate limiting | Kong/Envoy |
| Auth Service | Authentication & authorization | Keycloak/OIDC |
| Core Service | Primary business logic | Go/Rust |
| Data Service | Data management & persistence | Go + YugabyteDB |
| Event Bus | Async messaging | Redpanda/NATS |

### 3.2 Infrastructure Layer
| Component | Purpose | Technology |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Container Orchestration | Service deployment | Kubernetes |
| Service Mesh | Traffic management | Istio |
| Observability | Monitoring & logging | Prometheus + Grafana + Quickwit |
| Secret Management | Credentials | HashiCorp Vault |

## 4. Data Architecture

- **Primary Database**: YugabyteDB (distributed SQL)
- **Cache Layer**: DragonflyDB (Redis-compatible)
- **Search Engine**: Quickwit (log search & analytics)
- **Object Storage**: RustFS (S3-compatible)
- **Event Store**: Redpanda (Kafka-compatible)

## 5. Integration Architecture

```
[Clients] → [API Gateway] → [Core Services] → [Data Layer]
                ↓                    ↓
         [Auth Service]      [Event Bus] → [Async Processors]
```

## 6. Security Architecture

- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- JWT-based authentication
- RBAC authorization model
- Network segmentation via service mesh
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## 7. Deployment Architecture

- Multi-AZ Kubernetes clusters
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated rollback on failure
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform/Pulumi)
