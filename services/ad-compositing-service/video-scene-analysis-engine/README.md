# Video Scene Analysis Engine (VSAE)

This engine is responsible for analyzing video content (both VOD and live) to identify suitable opportunities for in-content ad placement. It uses computer vision to detect surfaces, objects, and track their position over time.

## Core Technologies

*   **Language:** Python
*   **CV Library:** OpenCV
*   **ML Framework:** PyTorch

## Next Steps

1.  Develop a Python script to process a video file using OpenCV.
2.  Implement a basic object detection model (e.g., YOLO via PyTorch) to identify common objects.
3.  Create a data structure to store and output the detected placement opportunities (timecodes, coordinates, etc.).
