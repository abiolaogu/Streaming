# Architectural Blueprint

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the architectural blueprint for the StreamVerse platform, a next-generation streaming service designed to support 100 million subscribers. The architecture is based on a microservices-based approach, with a focus on scalability, reliability, and performance.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The platform will be built on a microservices-based architecture, with each service responsible for a specific business capability. The services will be containerized using Docker and orchestrated using Kubernetes. The platform will be deployed on a multi-cloud environment, with a focus on fault tolerance and disaster recovery.

## 3. Technology Stack

*   **Programming Languages**: Go, Python, TypeScript
*   **Frameworks**: gRPC, Gin, React, Node.js
*   **Databases**: CockroachDB, ScyllaDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
*   **Messaging**: Kafka, gNATS
*   **Containerization**: Docker
*   **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
*   **Cloud Providers**: AWS, GCP, Azure

## 4. Key Architectural Principles

*   **Scalability**: The architecture will be designed to scale horizontally to support 100 million subscribers.
*   **Reliability**: The architecture will be designed to be highly reliable, with a goal of 99.999% uptime.
*   **Performance**: The architecture will be designed to be highly performant, with low latency and fast loading times.
*   **Security**: The architecture will be designed to be highly secure, with robust protection against all types of attacks.
*   **Maintainability**: The architecture will be designed to be easy to maintain and update, with a focus on clean code and good documentation.

## 5. Architectural Diagrams

*(This section will be updated with detailed architectural diagrams as the project progresses.)*
